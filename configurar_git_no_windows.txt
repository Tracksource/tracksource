You apparently made your whole workspace into a git repo

Delete/backup your repo (the workspace/.git folder)
Go to github and create a new repo - say you name it my-project
Install msysgit. You will have to work with it sooner or later
Right click on your project folder and choose Git Bash here
Issue

$ git init
$ echo bin/ >> .gitignore # exclude the bin folder !
$ git add -A && git commit -m "All my files" # this will commit *all*
# better fire up the gui and choose what to commit
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/my-project.git
$ git push -u origin master
